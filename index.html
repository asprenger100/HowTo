    <h1 style="color:#ff0000;text-align:center">How to be Successful as an Offensive Lineman in Football</h1>
    <p class="section">Being a lineman isn't always the most glorious position on the football field, but it is one of the most rewarding. While the skill positions may get a lot of credit, none of their success would be possible without a strong line. If you are reading this I hope you have decided to be a lineman or at least have an interest in becoming one. Some people may try to tell you that you have to be big in order to be good at it, but that's just not true. Strength is a big part of it as well as <b>quickness</b>. If you aren't fast, this is a perfect position for you. In football there is a difference between being fast and quick. <b>Quickness</b> is all about <i>coordination</i> and <i>mental toughness</i>, both are things that can be improved on. Speed is a <u>natural ability</u>. It can be improved to a point with training, but if you don't have the potential for world class speed, you'll never be able to attain it. If you have <b>heart</b> you will do well.</p>
    <h2 style="color:#ff0000">Stance</h2>
    <p class="section">First, you need a good stance. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart. Now bend your knees until you are in an athletic stance. You want to be <b>balanced</b>. Some people put their weight on the balls of their feet; however, this sometimes isn't the best for your balance. This position should be <b>comfortable</b>. If it's not, then you need to spend some more time in it to loosen up your hips. Once you can comfortably sit in that position, lightly put one of your hands down. Which one is completely up to you, but normally right handed players put their right hand down and left handed players do the opposite. Some people put weight on that forward hand. This puts you off balanced. It may give you a <u>slight</u> advantage for run plays, but it will make pass blocking <u>much harder</u>. if the defensive player notices a difference in your stance depending on the play, you give away the play. Because of this, it's <i>vital</i> stance looks the same everytime you go down.</p>
    <h2 style="color:#ff0000">Start</h2>
    <p class="section">Now from that stance you have to be able to get out of it quickly. As a lineman, we go off on the quarterback's <b>cadance</b>. You want to get out quick because it's one of the advantages you hve on the defensive lineman. You know the count, and they do not. To ensure that you get off you must know the count, anticipate when your QB says the <b>first syllable</b> of the last word, and immediately take your correct first step forward. You have to pay attention to the play and the snap count in the hudddle. If you go too early, you will get a five yard penalty. If you go too late, you won't be able to do reach your blocking assignment early enough. <b>Anticipating</b> has everything to do with your <i>mentality and practice</i>. Work with your QB to get to know his cadannce because every QB has a <u>different timing</u>. This takes lots of <i>time and effort</i>. The next step is to take the correct step forward. As we talk more about the correct technique for blocking, we will dive further into which foot you step with. But make sure you step <b>forward</b>. Football is a game of <i>inches</i>, and you <u>can't afford to give up anything</u>. Also if you are stepping backwards, you <u>slow yourself down</u>. This is another thing that takes <i>practice</i> and a <i>tough mentality</i>. Practice and having a tough mentality are common themes of being a lineman.</p>
    <h2 style="color:#ff0000">Blocking Form</h2>
    <p class="section">Finally we are going to talk about blocking technique. First, you need to figure out which foot you are stepping with initially. If you need to block with your <i>right</i> shoulder to move the defender <i>right</i>, you start with your <b>left</b> foot. You use the <b>right</b> foot when blocking with your <i>left</i> shoulder. There is a table below for you to view it visually. What shoulder you are trying to use is entirely based on the playbook of the team you are playing on. It is important for you to <u>study your playbook</u>. A football team is <i>only as storng as its weakest link</i>. If you don't know your plays, you cannot be successful, and neither can your team. Once you get your first step in, you need to keep your strides <i>short</i> until you reach the defender. Maintain the <b>low level</b> you start with while you are in your stance. A phrase that I use to remind myself and others to stay low with is, <i><q>Eyes through the thighs.</q></i> Your level should place your eye level around where the defender's thighs are. As you make contact with the defender, the first point of contact should be the <b>front</b> of your shoulder, <u>not the top</u>. This is a common mistake. If you hit the defender with the front of your shoulder, your head shoud be up and your butt down. The shape that your back makes when you are in this position is called the <i>"swayback horse."</i> You can get more comforatble in this position by stayng in it for periods of time. Once again, make sure you are <b>balanced</b>. After you make first contact in this position, you have to drive the defender off his current spot. To do this, you use <i>"short and choppy steps."</i> Once again you take short strides, very quickly. This type of stepping maximizes your <b>drive</b> and <b>prevents slipping</b> in wet and slipery conditions.</p>
